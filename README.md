# Mus-ik

## Description
Users will be able to sign in or sign up if an account is not created for them yet, they will be able to 
look at playlists they have saved to the webpage and they will also be able to to create and delete playlists on the playlists tabs.
We just Chalk a npm libary package that adds more customization to the terminal instead of being dull and boring. We learned how to
make pages only be accessible once they are logged in and each playlist page is specific to the specific user.

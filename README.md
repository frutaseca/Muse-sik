# Mus-ik

## Description
Users will be able to sign in or sign up if an account is not created for them yet, they will be able to 
look at playlists they have saved to the webpage and they will also be able to to create and delete playlists on the playlists tabs.
We just Chalk a npm libary package that adds more customization to the terminal instead of being dull and boring. We learned how to
make pages only be accessible once they are logged in and each playlist page is specific to the specific user.

## User Story
```
AS A user
I WANT to sign up for the website
SO THAT I can create playlists for my music
```
## Acceptance Critera
```
GIVEN a websie
WHEN I access the first page
THEN I click login on the top left
WHEN I get onto said page I either sign in or sign up if I do not have an account
THEN I am sent back to main page with navbar visible
WHEN I click on the playlist button
THEN I am sent to the playlist page where I can see my playlist if any or I can create a playlist
WHEN I create a playlist it appears next to the input bar with a delete button next to my playlist
THEN If I were to click on the delete button on a playlist the playlist will be deleted
